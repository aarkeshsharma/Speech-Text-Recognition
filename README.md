# Speech-Text-Recognition(Using Multilingual language)

# Introduction

Speech recognition, also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition, or speech-to-text, is a capability which enables a program to process human speech into a written format. 
While it’s commonly confused with voice recognition, speech recognition focuses on the translation of speech from a verbal format to a text one whereas voice recognition just seeks to identify an individual user’s voice

# Why?

Text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) - is the automatic conversion of a text into speech that resembles, as closely as possible, a native speaker of the language reading that text.
This technology which lets computer speak to you. The TTS system gets the text as the input and then a computer algorithm which called TTS engine analyses

Speech-to-Text (STT) - which allows computer to translate voice request and dictation into text, this application enables machines to respond correctly and reliably to human voices and provide useful and valuable services.
Recognizing the speaker can simplify the task of translating speech in systems that have been trained on a specific person's voice or it can be used to write certain text or document with the use of human voices.

# Operating Environment

You need a Browser which supports WEB SPEECH, JAVASCRIPT & other Components like HTML, CSS, JQUERY, AJAX (Google Chrome)

# Downloading the Source Code
Clone the Repository (Recommended) If you have git installed, this is a recommended approach as you can quickly sync and stay up to date with the latest version. 
This is also a preferred way of downloading the code if you decide to contribute to the project.

$ git clone https://github.com/aarkeshsharma/Speech-Text-Recognition.git Download the code as a zip file
